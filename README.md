## slow-loom

A toy project inspired by [loom](https://github.com/tokio-rs/loom). This crate has no fancy algorithms for
performance improvement, it just explores all state spaces, so it runs slowly. But it is much cooler to implement a model checker than other rust toy projects. 

 -[x] detection of deadlock 
 -[x] detection of violations of assertions
